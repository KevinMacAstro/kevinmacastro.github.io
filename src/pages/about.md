I am currently a NASA postdoctoral fellow with a home center at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA working on observational systematics related to slitless grism spectroscopy for the ESA's Euclid Consortium's Galaxy Clustering Science Working Group. This work is relevant for the upcoming NASA's Roman Space Telescope High Latitude Spectroscopic Survey, which will also be employing slitless spectroscopy to identify the redshifts for emission-line galaxies. My PhD research explored the galaxy-dark matter halo connection, specifically the presence of galaxy assembly bias.
